There will be no grade changes after the final project.\n\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusiveness\nOur view is that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives will be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class iss a resource, strength, and benefit.\n\n\nDisability Policy\nStudents with disabilities who need accommodations are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability, Access & Inclusion as soon as possible to ensure that accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.\n\n\nHonor code\nAcademic dishonesty will not be tolerated and is grounds for dismissal from the class with a failing grade (“F”). For other information, please consult the Graduate Student Handbook.\nChatGPT will probably be able to answer most coding questions you ask of it. While it is useful for fleshing out an initial approach from pseudocode, we do not recommend using it, as these conceptual approaches are an essential foundation for buildling expertise in bioinformatic analysis."

Any reused code that is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nYou can discuss the content of assignments with others in this class. If you do so, you must acknowledge your collaborator(s) at the top of your assignment, for example: “Collaborators: Hillary and Bernie”. Failure to acknowledge collaborators will result in a grade of 0. You may not copy code and/or answers directly from another student. If you copy other work, both parties will receive a grade of 0.\nThe problem set with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.\nRather than copying someone’s work, ask for help.

Values in parentheses represent point values for each level from 20 points total. This rubric will be assessed at the end of the semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nExpert\nCompetent\nNeeds Improvement\n\n\n\n\nCoding style\nStudent has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding manual is followed, code is well commented\nCoding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments\nMany errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable\n\n\nCoding strategy\nComplicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors\nCode is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some “hacking” instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors.\nCode tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors.\n\n\nPresentation: graphs\nGraph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point\nGraph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels.\nGraph(s) poorly chosen to support questions.\n\n\nPresentation: tables\nTable(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features.\nTable(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.\nTable(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.\n\n\nAchievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity\nStudent has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.\nTools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.\nStudent does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.\n\n\nEase of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work\nAccess as easy as possible, code runs!\nSatisfactory\nNot an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipation rubric\nAttendance & participation is worth 20% of your grade. Values in parentheses represent point values for each level from 20 points total. This rubric will be assessed at the end of the semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nExpert\nCompetent\nNeeds improvement\n\n\n\n\nAttendance (physically present for class, or coordinating with instructor when absent)\nAttends class regularly (5)\nAttends most classes (4)\nAttends some classes (0-3)\n\n\nPreparation (activities required for in-class participation, like surveys and software installation)\nCompletes requested activities prior to class (5)\nCompletes most requested activities prior to class, sometimes needs to finish during class (4)\nRarely completes requested activities prior to class, often takes class time to complete (0-3)\n\n\nEngagement (in-class activities like coding exercises and discussion)\nActively engages in class activities (10)\nSometimes engages in class activities (8)\nDoesn’t engage in class activities (0-7)"
