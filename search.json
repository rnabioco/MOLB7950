Values in parentheses represent point values for each level from 20 points total.

Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors\nCode is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some “hacking” instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors.\nCode tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors.\n\n\nPresentation: graphs\nGraph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point\nGraph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels.\nGraph(s) poorly chosen to support questions.\n\n\nPresentation: tables\nTable(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features.\nTable(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.\nTable(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.\n\n\nAchievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity\nStudent has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.\nTools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.\nStudent does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.\n\n\nEase of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work\nAccess as easy as possible, code runs!\nSatisfactory\nNot an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipation rubric\nAttendance & participation is worth 20% of your grade. Values in parentheses represent point values for each level from 20 points total. This rubric will be assessed at the end of the semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nExpert\nCompetent\nNeeds improvement\n\n\n\n\nAttendance (physically present for class, or coordinating with instructor when absent)\nAttends class regularly (5)\nAttends most classes (4)\nAttends some classes (0-3)\n\n\nPreparation (activities required for in-class participation, like surveys and software installation)\nCompletes requested activities prior to class (5)\nCompletes most requested activities prior to class, sometimes needs to finish during class (4)\nRarely completes requested activities prior to class, often takes class time to complete (0-3)\n\n\nEngagement (in-class activities like coding exercises and discussion)\nActively engages in class activities (10)\nSometimes engages in class activities (8)\nDoesn’t engage in class activities (0-7)"

    "text": "A yeast gene expression experiment\nNext, we’ll examine some gene expression data from the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. We’ll roughly follow the analysis strategy taken by David Robinson in his blog Variance Explained.\nThe data come from:\n\nBrauer MJ, Huttenhower C, Airoldi EM, Rosenstein R, Matese JC, Gresham D, Boer VM, Troyanskaya OG, Botstein D. Coordination of growth rate, cell cycle, stress response, and metabolic activity in yeast. Mol Biol Cell. 2008 [Link]\n\nThey used chemostats to control the growth rate of cells under different nutrient-limited conditions.\nIn this experiment, cells were grown in different media limited for (one of) glucose, uracil, leucine, sulfate, phosphate, or ammonia. Over a series of fixed, equilibrium growth rates (established by the dilution rate of fresh media), cells were harvested and gene expression was measured by genome-wide microarrays.\nThis is a well organized experiment (so it’s useuful for teaching / learning), but there’s nothing particularly special about the setup.\n\nWe could be measuring protein or metabolite levels instead of gene expression, or analyzing cell features from images taken of the cells.\nWe might be adding an increasing amount of a drug candidate instead of nutrient deprivation\nWe might be altering the growth density of mammalian cells (by plating) instead of controlling growth rate in a chemostat.\n\nLoad libraries\nLoad libraries you’ll need for the analysis below.\nLoad the data\nA raw version of the gene expression data are in:\n\ndata/brauer_gene_exp_wide.tsv.gz\n\nIn addition, another tibbles contains related information:\n\ndata/yeast_go_terms.tsv.gz\n\nLoad each of the above files and inspect.\n\nbrauer_gene_exp_wide &lt;- ___ \nyeast_go_terms &lt;- ___\n\nTidy the data\nAre these data tidy?\n\nbrauer_gene_exp_tidy &lt;-\n  pivot_longer(\n    data = ___,\n    cols = ___,\n    names_to = \"___\",\n    values_to = \"___\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  separate(\n    ___,\n    into = c(\"___\", \"___\"),\n    sep = 1,\n    convert = TRUE\n  )\n\nNext, we want to update the nutrient abbreviations so they’re easier to remember.\n\nnutrient_abbrs &lt;- tribble(\n  ~ nutrient_abbr, ~ nutrient,\n  \"G\", \"Glucose\",\n  \"L\", \"Leucine\",\n  \"P\", \"Phosphate\",\n  \"S\", \"Sulfate\",\n  \"N\", \"Ammonia\",\n  \"U\", \"Uracil\"\n)\n\n# now, we need to *join* the tibbles\nbrauer_gene_exp_tidy &lt;-\n  left_join(___, ___) |&gt;\n  # drop the nutrient abbreviation \n  select(___)\n\nNext, we want the common gene names, which contain useful information for filtering and grouping.

Start with the ‘PHO’, ‘URA’, and ‘SUL’ genes. Comment on features that stand out, both within and across nutrient deprivation conditions.\nWhat if you include and group by the GO terms in the yeast_go_terms tibble instead of gene name? I.e., you could detect the string leucine in the biological process and group by those instead of gene name (you’d need to join the tidy tibble with the GO information first).\nAre there other genes that behave like LEU1 under leucine starvation? I.e., a strong negative slope in one condition, and positive slopes in the others?"

These procedures allow for type 1 errors (false positives) but control the proportion of these false positives in relation to true positives. This is done by adjusting the decision made for the p-value associated with each individual test to decide rejection or not.

    "text": "Let’s calculate the empirical p-value of the cluster most enriched for DUX4 targets by sampling\nIn order to do this, you will need to:\n\nIdentify which cluster is the most enriched for DUX4 targets.\n\nDetermine how many genes are in the cluster. You will need to know this to figure out how many genes to sample from the whole data set.\nDetermine how many of the genes in the cluster are DUX4 targets. This is the metric that you are interested in comparing between the null distribution and your observation.\n\n\nGenerate 1000 random sample of the proper size from all genes and find out how many of them are DUX4 targets.\nVisualize the distribution of DUX4 targets in these 1000 random (your null distribution) and overlay the number of DUX4 targets you observed in the cluster that was most enriched for DUX4 targets."
