## Course Overview

MOLB 7950 is a hands-on tutorial of skills and theory needed to process,
analyze, and visualize output from large biological data sets. We
emphasize the R statistical computing environment.

🗓️ Class will run from Aug 28 - Nov 1

📍 Classes will be held in-person in [**AHSB
2200**](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=95#!m/601768)

🕘 Class time is 9:00-10:30am

MOLB 7950 is a three credit hour course.

The course is divided into blocks:

### Bootcamp

THe **Bootcamp block** covers R programming and introduces important
statistical concepts and approaches. We will also cover data types you
will encounter during biological data analysis and approaches for their
analysis.

During the bootcamp block, we will meet everyday for 90 minutes to cover
fundamental concepts you will need throughout the course.

### Experimental blocks

After Bootcamp, will cover experimental approaches used to analyze DNA
and RNA. Each block spans \~4 weeks, with each week focused on a
particular type of experiment (see below). Each block covers statistical
concepts needed for rigorous analysis and analysis approaches to process
raw data to results (tables and figures) using reproducible coding
techniques.

In most weeks we will discuss and analyze data from a publication. You
are responsible for reading the week's material before class begins on
Monday.

#### Block experiments

1.  The **DNA block** covers genome sequencing for identifying
    mutations, and two approaches for analyzing chromatin state
    (ChIP-seq and MNase-seq).

2.  The **RNA block** covers RNA-seq, alternative splicing, differential
    gene expression, and RNA:protein interactions.

## Schedule

Classes begin on August 28 and end on November 1. Dates are from the
[Fall 2023 Academic
Calendar](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/registrar/academic-calendars/2022-2023).

During the **Bootcamp** block, classes will be held every day, Mon-Fri
from **9:00-10:30am**.

During the **DNA & RNA blocks**, we will have in-class exercises and
discussion on Mon-Wed-Fri **9:00-10:30am**.

## Location

Classes will be held in-person in **AHSB 2201**. All classes will be
recorded and made available through Canvas.

## Policies

### Attendance

Class attendance is a firm expectation; frequent absences or tardiness
are considered cause for a grade reduction.

**if you are sick, please let us know (e-mail Jay and Neel) and stay
home**.

Anticipated absences outside of sickness should be reported to the
instructors of a given block as soon as possible to make plans for
possible accommodation.

We will record all lectures on Panopto and they will be available online
through Canvas.

### Late and missed work

We have a late work policy for homework assignments:

-   If a problem set set is late but within 24 hours of due date/time,
    the grade will be reduced by 50%

-   If a problem set is returned any later, no credit will be given.

-   All regrade requests must be discussed with the professor within one
    week of receiving your grade. There will be no grade changes after
    the final project.

### Diversity & Inclusiveness

Our view is that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives
will be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be
addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the
students bring to this class iss a resource, strength, and benefit.

### Disability Policy

Students with disabilities who need accommodations are encouraged to
contact the [Office of Disability, Access &
Inclusion](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/office-of-disability-access-and-inclusion)
as soon as possible to ensure that accommodations are implemented in a
timely fashion.

### Honor code

**Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated** and is grounds for
dismissal from the class with a failing grade ("F"). For other
information, please consult the [Graduate Student
Handbook](https://graduateschool.cuanschutz.edu/docs/librariesprovider138/denver-anschutz-graduate-school/resources/graduate-school-policies-and-procedures-mar2022.pdf?sfvrsn=be3a83ba_2).

ChatGPT will probably be able to answer most coding questions you ask of it.
While it is useful for fleshing out an initial approach from pseudocode,
we do not recommend using it, as these conceptual approaches are an essential foundation for buildling expertise in bioinformatic analysis.

## Problem Sets

-   Problem sets will be assigned at the end of each class.

-   You can use external resources but **must explicitly cite** where
    you have obtained code (both code you used directly and
    "paraphrased" code / code used as inspiration). Any reused code that
    is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

-   You can discuss the content of assignments with others in this
    class. If you do so, you must acknowledge your collaborator(s) at
    the top of your assignment, for example: "Collaborators: Hillary and
    Bernie". Failure to acknowledge collaborators will result in a grade
    of 0. You **may not** copy code and/or answers **directly** from
    another student. If you copy other work, both parties will receive a
    grade of 0.

-   The problem set with the lowest score for each student will be
    dropped.

-   Rather than copying someone's work, [ask for
    help](support.qmd). You are not alone in this
    course!

## Professionalism

-   Please refrain from texting or using your computer for anything
    other than coursework during class.

## Assignments and Grading

The course measures learning through daily problem sets, a final
project, and your participation.

| **Type**      | **% of grade** |
|:--------------|---------------:|
| Problem Sets  |             60 |
| Final Project |             20 |
| Participation |             20 |

Grades will be assigned as follows:

| **Percent total points** | **Grade** |
|:-------------------------|----------:|
| \>= 95                   | A         |
| \>= 90                   | A-        |
| \>= 85                   | B+        |
| \>= 80                   | B         |

### Problem sets

We reinforce concepts with problem sets assigned at the end of class
that should take \~60 minutes to complete.

Problems sets assigned on Friday will be more substantial, requiring \~1-2 hours
to complete.

Together the problem sets constitute 60% of your grade.

### Final projects

Final projects can be completed in groups of 1-3 people. Projects will
involve analysis of existing public data sets and end with a short
presentation the last week of class. The final project constitutes 20%
of your grade.

### Grading Rubrics

#### Problem Set Rubric

Problem sets are worth 60% of your grade. Values in parentheses
represent point values for each level from 20 points total. This rubric
will be assessed at the end of the semester.

{{< include ../includes/_rubric-problem-sets.qmd >}}

#### Participation rubric

Attendance & participation is worth 20% of your grade. Values in parentheses
represent point values for each level from 20 points total. This rubric
will be assessed at the end of the semester.

## Related coursework

In previous iterations of this course, we taught command-line (bash,
grep, awk, etc) and Python programming. These skills are 
useful, but for consistency we opted to focus on R programming and
RStudio as an analysis environment.

AMC also offers [shorter workshops](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/rbi/training-and-education/graduate-courses) on specific analysis strategies that
you might find helpful.
