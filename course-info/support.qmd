## How to get help

### Discussion

Course discussion will be through the Slack MOLB7950 organization.

Guidelines for using Slack:

-   Use dedicated channels for discussion in `#class`, questions about
    your `#problem-sets`, and your `#final-project`
-   You can ask for help by tagging the TAs in the `#class` channel. If
    you post `@ta help`, someone will start a thread where you can ask a
    question.
-   If needed, we can talk face-to-face via the `/zoom` integration.

### Office Hours

-   Our TAs will be available Mon-Fri afternoons from 1-3pm.
