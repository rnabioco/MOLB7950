# Gene regulation by chromatin

## 

## Chromatin structure

## DNA accessibility drives all biochemical transactions on the genome

-   Transcription Initiation
-   Transcription Elongation
-   DNA Repair
-   Initiation of DNA Replication
-   Recombination
-   Viral Integration

## Mapping & measurement are first steps toward understanding. {.smaller}

Before genome-wide DNA accessibility measurements, we knew about chromatin transactions at only a handful of sequences.

This was a classic "keys under the lamppost" situation.
