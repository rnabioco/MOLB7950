We have entered a new era (Swifties unite) wherein routine application of long-read sequencing is revealing new principles of gene regulation.

## Comparing data from short- and long-read experiments {.smaller}

## Things that are invisible to short-read sequencing {.smaller}

**Genomic features greater 500 bp in size (i.e., the size of an Illumina fragment):**

- Patterns of pre-mRNA splicing (which exons / introns in a molecule)
- Structural genomic variants
- Chromatin structure across a single locus.

. . .

Patterns we have examined in class rely on patterns that emerge from *many, small* DNA or RNA fragments.

Long-read experiments examine *single molecules* and can capture patterns captured in *single* DNA fragments.

## DNA case study -- T2T {.smaller}

The T2T (telomere-to-telomere) consortium used long-read sequencing to define the first complete draft of a human genome, including telomeric and centromeric repeats.

## Applications beyond long-read nucleic acid sequencing {.smaller}

We might be able to sequence proteins soon. Why is this cool?
