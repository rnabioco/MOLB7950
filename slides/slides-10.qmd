## Learning objective stats-bootcamp

-   Familiarity with probabilities, distributions, and descriptive statistics

-   Perform exploratory data analysis

-   Know which statistical methods are appropriate for your data

-   Understand and execute different statistical approaches

-   "You can't be neutral on a moving train"

## Class overview

-   Motivation for why stats are important

-   History of stats

## Why do we need to know statistics?

As **scientists** we need to assign confidence to our results.

-   Convince ourselves

-   Convince other scientists

-   Convince the public (additional challenges)

## Stats + probability are not intuitive

-   See patterns where there are none
-   Miss patterns we are NOT expecting
-   We tend to be overconfident
-   Bad at Bayesian thinking
-   Don't do well with dependencies
-   Don't update expectations with new evidence

## See patterns where there are none {.smaller}

ALWAYS visualize your data.

## Trouble with updating, pt 1

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors:

Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.

You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.

They then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?"

Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

## Trouble with updating, pt 2

## You can't be neutral on a moving train

Howard Zinn: "To Be Neutral, To Be Passive In A Situation Is To Collaborate With Whatever Is Going On"

```         
Zinn, a prolific writer and scholar, tore down the wall intended to separate activism — or partisanship — from the professed objectivity of scholarship. Instead Zinn told his students that he did not “pretend to an objectivity that was neither possible nor desirable. ‘You can’t be neutral on a moving train,’ I would tell them...Events are already moving in certain deadly directions, and to be neutral means to accept that.”

Zinn is writing in response to the timeless questions that burn within anyone who cares about creating a more just society and world. Is change possible? Where will it come from? Can we actually make a difference? How do you remain hopeful? 
```

## Fathers of statistics

-   Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911)
-   Karl Pearson (1857-1936)
-   Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962)

## Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911)

-   Discovered regression to the mean

-   Re-discovered correlation and regression and discovered how to apply these in anthropology, psychology, and more

-   Defined the concept of standard deviation

-   Established the field of Eugenics in 1883

-   Darwin's cousin.

## Galton's reasoning for coining the term eugenics:

> "We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which...takes cognisance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had."

## Karl Pearson (1857-1936)

Pearson was Galton's protégé and developed/contributed to:

-   Developed hypothesis testing

-   Developed the use of p-values

-   Defined the Chi-Squared test

-   Correlation coefficient

-   Principle components analysis

## Pearson authored of timeless "classics" such as:

[The Woman's Question](https://archive.org/details/ethicoffreethoug00pear/page/370/mode/2up?view=theater)

[National Life from the standpoint of science](https://archive.org/details/nationallifefro00peargoog/page/n12/mode/2up?view=theater)

## Pearson, eugenics, and anti-semitism

In the year Mein Kampf was published, Pearson wrote an article called:\
[**THE PROBLEM OF ALIEN IMMIGRATION INTO GREAT BRITAIN, ILLUSTRATED BY AN EXAMINATION OF RUSSIAN AND POLISH JEWISH CHILDREN**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1925.tb02037.x)

> "\[they\] will develop into a parasitic race...Taken *on the average*, and regarding both sexes, this alien Jewish population is somewhat inferior physically and mentally to the native population."

## Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962)

Fisher's work in statistics established and promoted many important methods of statistical inference. His contributions include:

-   Establishing p = 0.05 as the normal threshold for significant p-values

-   Promoting Maximum Likelihood Estimation

-   Developing the ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA)

-   [The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Genetical_Theory_of_Natural_Selection), which blended the work of Mendel and Darwin.

## Fisher and eugenics

There is no lack of Fisher's strong and consistent support for eugenics. Here is an example from as late as 1954.

## Storytime, pt I

-   Galton founded the Eugenics Record Office (1904)

-   Galton Eugenics Laboratory within University College London (UCL). Created by Pearson and funded by Galton. (1907)

-   Galton left UCL enough money to create a Chair in National Eugenics, filled by Pearson and then Fisher.

-   *Annals of Human Genetics* was established in 1925 Pearson as the Annals of Eugenics, and obtained its current name in 1954.

-   Galton laboratory was incorporated into the Department of Eugenics, Biometry and Genetic at UCL in 1944.

## Storytime, pt II

-   Renamed to the Department of Human Genetics and Biometry in 1966.

-   Became part of the Department of Biology at UCL in 1996.

-   In 2020: [UCL renames three facilities that honoured prominent eugenicists](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/19/ucl-renames-three-facilities-that-honoured-prominent-eugenicists)

**These views did not appear to be common at UCL in the 1930s. For example, they were not held by JBS Haldane, Egon Pearson (son of Karl), and Lionel Penrose.**

An academic study debunked the idea of "Screening Human Embryos for Polygenic Traits," but the CEO of the company Stephen Hsu cofounded announced that they had screened human embryos for polygenic traits.\

## Just a product of their time

From: [Statistics, Eugenics, and Me](https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-eugenics-and-me-29eaf43efac7)

```         
Sitting idly by as this happens will make us ‘a product of their time’. This is not good enough. Data Science needs more regulation. Doctors have the Hippocratic Oath, why don’t we have the Nightingale Oath: “Manipulate no data nor results. Promote ethical uses of statistics. Only train models you understand. Don’t promote Eugenics”.
```
