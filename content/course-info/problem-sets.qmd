## Problem Set Overview

### Problem sets

We reinforce concepts with problem sets assigned at the end of each
class. During the main blocks, problem sets on Mon and Wed should take
\~60 minutes to complete. Problems sets assigned on Friday will be more
substantial, requiring \~1-2 hours to complete. Together the problem
sets constitute 60% of your grade.

| **Assigned** | **Due**      | **Grades By** | **Who grades**    | **Time to complete (approx)** |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Mon \@ 12pm  | Tues \@ 5pm  | Wed \@ 5pm    | Instructors / TAs | 60 min                        |
| Wed \@ 12pm  | Thurs \@ 5pm | Fri \@ 5pm    | Instructors / TAs | 60 min                        |
| Fri \@ 12pm  | Mon \@ 5pm   | Wed \@ 5pm    | Instructors / TAs | 1-2 hr                        |

### Problem Set Grading Rubric

Problem sets are worth 60% of your grade. Values in parentheses
represent point values for each level from 20 points total. This rubric
will be assessed at the end of the semester.

| Coding style                                                                         | Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding manual is followed, code is well commented                                                                                                                                  | Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments                                                                        | Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable                                                     |
| Coding strategy                                                                      | Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors | Code is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some "hacking" instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors.                           | Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors.     |
| Presentation: graphs                                                                 | Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point                                                                                                                                                              | Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels.                                                                       | Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions.                                                                                             |
| Presentation: tables                                                                 | Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features.                                                                                                            | Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.                                                                                      | Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.    |
| Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity                                         | Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.                                               | Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition. | Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope. |
| Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work | Access as easy as possible, code runs!                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Satisfactory                                                                                                                                                         | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run                                            |
