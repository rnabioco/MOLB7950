Remember: in tidy data, every column represents a single\nvariable and every row represents a single observation\n\n### Answer below\n\n## Question 3 \n\n**How will you reshape the data frame so that each row has only one experimental observation?**\n\nHint: Use `pivot_longer()`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 4\n\n**How will you modify the dataframe so that multiple variables are not present in a single column?**\n\nHint: Use `separate()`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 5 \n\n**How will you save your output as a TSV file?**\n\nHint: Use the *readr* cheatsheet to figure this out.\n\nhttps://rstudio.cloud/learn/cheat-sheets\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
