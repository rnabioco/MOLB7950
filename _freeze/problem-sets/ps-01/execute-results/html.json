When in doubt, start by loading the tidyverse package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1\n\nCreate 3 different vectors called `x`, `y`, and `z`:\n\n-   `x` should be character vector of length 5\n-   `y` should be a numerica vector of length 5\n-   `z` should be a logical vector of length 5\n\nUse `length()` to calculate the length of each vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2\n\nUsing the vectors you created above, create a new tibble with column names `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\nUse `nrow()` and `ncol()` to calculate the number of rows and columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWhat do you notice about the length of the vectors and the number of rows?\n\n### Answer here\n\n## Submit\n\nBe sure to click the \"Render\" button to render the HTML output.\n\nThen paste the URL of this Posit Cloud project into the problem set on Canvas.\n",
