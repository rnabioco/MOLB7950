Calculate the mean of the technical replicates within each group of genotype, time, gene, and biological replicate.\n\n2. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the biolgical replicates (which is the mean of technical replicates, above).\n\nYou should have a tibble that looks like this:\n\n```\n# A tibble: 36 × 5\n   gt         time gene     bio_mean bio_sd\n   <chr>     <int> <chr>       <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 RL-mutant     0 GAPDH       0.444 0.0759\n 2 RL-mutant     0 IFN-beta    3.32  0.188 \n 3 RL-mutant     4 GAPDH       1.61  0.487 \n 4 RL-mutant     4 IFN-beta   18.4   1.15  \n 5 RL-mutant     8 GAPDH       3.25  1.06  \n 6 RL-mutant     8 IFN-beta   32.2   1.82  \n 7 RL-mutant    12 GAPDH       3.90  0.911 \n 8 RL-mutant    12 IFN-beta   47.5   3.78  \n 9 RL-mutant    24 GAPDH       7.93  3.41  \n10 RL-mutant    24 IFN-beta   76.7   4.75  \n# ℹ 26 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2 (4 points)\n\n1. Create a plot of expression by time from the data, using the mean of the biological replicates as the `y` value.\n\n2. Color the plot by genes.\n\n3. Use `ggplot2::geom_pointrange()` do represent the standard deviation of the data. Alternatively, use `ggplot2::geom_errobar()` with `geom_point()`.\n\n4. Draw a line through the points with `geom_line()`.\n\n4. Facet the plot by genotype.\n\n5. Change the colors of the of the plot with a `scale` function.\n\n6. Update the labels on the plot (\"time (hours)\", etc.).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 3 (4 points)\n\n- What can you say about the expression of GAPDH and IFN in the different cell types?\n\n> Answer.\n\n- Can you come up with a simple molecular mechanism to explain the results?\n\n> Answer.\n\n## Question 4 (4 points)\n\nReformat the data from Question 2 such that you calculate a ratio of IFN to GAPDH. Start with the data Question 1.2, above.\n\nRe-plot the data as in Question 2, but leave out the color as you have collapsed the two genes into one value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 5 (4 points)\n\nIs there more spread across the technical replicates, or across the biological replicates (across the whole experiment)?\n\nTo get at this question, calculate the standard deviations across the two sets of replicates separately. Which one has a greater spread (max - min)? And what might this mean?\n\n> Answer.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Grading rubric\n\n- Everything is good: full points\n- Partially correct answer: depends on how many steps are correct\n- Reasonable attempt: half points\n\n## Submit\n\nBe sure to click the \"Render\" button to render the HTML output.\n\nThen paste the URL of this Posit Cloud project into the problem set on Canvas.\n",
