Read the two papers in the [preparation](prepare/prepare-17.qmd) document before class on Wed.\n\n2. Look over the vignettes for the software in the preparation document. Use valr to complete the tasks below. These problems are due Wed at 5pm.\n\nEach problem below is worth **5 points**.\n\n## Setup\n\nLoad libraries you'll need for analysis below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.3     v readr     2.1.4\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.0\nv ggplot2   3.4.3     v tibble    3.2.1\nv lubridate 1.9.2     v tidyr     1.3.0\nv purrr     1.0.2     \n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(valr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1 -- 5 points\n\nWe'll work with a few different files for the next questions.\n\n- `hg19.refGene.chr22.bed.gz` is a BED12 file containing gene (mRNA) information for chr22.\n- `hg19.rmsk.chr22.bed.gz` is a BED6 containing repetitive elements in the human genome.\n- `hg19.dnase1.bw` is a bigWig file containing DNase-seq signal.\n\nYou can find the path to each with `valr_example()`. Load each one individually using the valr `read_*` functions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nSome valr functions require a \"genome\" file, which is just a tibble of chromosome names and sizes.\n\nThe hg19 genome file is available at `valr_example(\"hg19.chrom.sizes.gz\")`. Use `read_genome()` to load it.\n\nInspect the tibble. How many columns does it have? What is the largest chromosome?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2 -- 5 points\n \nWhich repeat class covers the largest amount of chromosome 22? Use dplyr tools to analyze the repeats in `hg19.rmsk.chr22.bed.gz`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 3 -- 5 points\n\nWhich promoter has the highest DNase I accessibility?\n\n1. Use the valr `create_tss()` function to generate transcription start sites from the BED12 refGene annotations. How big are these intervals?\n2. Generate promoter regions from the TSS with `bed_slop()`, adding 500 bp up- and downstream (i.e., both sides). `bed_slop()` requires the genome file above. How big are the regions now?\n3. Use `bed_map()` to calculate the total (i.e., summed) DNase I signal in the promoters (using the `score` column in the DNase file).\n\nWhich gene has the highest DNase I in the regions you defined above?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Submit\n\nBe sure to click the \"Render\" button to render the HTML output.\n\nThen paste the URL of this Posit Cloud project into the problem set on Canvas.\n",
