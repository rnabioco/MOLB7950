Load the tidyverse and here packages.  \n2. Import datasets: `data/data_rna_protein.csv.gz`.\n\n`data_rna_protein.csv.gz`: This is a combined dataset from an RNAseq and SILAC\nproteomics experiment, where a transcription factor (TF) was differentially\nexpressed and the fold change in RNA and protein calculated between\nTF-expressing and non-expressing cells.\n   \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2 **9 points**\n\nUsing the imported data set, carry out the following:  \n\n1. Inspect the data so you know what you are dealing with (`summary()` etc). \n\n2. Select only the following columns: `geneid`, `iDUX4_logFC`, `iDUX4_fdr`,\n   `hl.ratio`, and `pval`.\n\n3. Rename them as follows: rna_FC = iDUX4_logFC, rna_pval = iDUX4_fdr,\n   protein_FC = hl.ratio, protein_pval = pval (hint: use `dplyr::rename()`)\n\n4. Drop all rows with `NA` values in them (hint: use a function from `tidyr`)\n\n6. Remove duplicate rows (hint: use `dplyr::distinct()`).\n\n7. Arrange the table by descending `rna_FC` and ascending \n   `protein_FC`.\n   \n8. Conduct steps 2-7 by piping the output of one step to another (i.e, a single\n   workflow & remember to comment).\n   \n9. Save the output of this workflow into a new object.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 3  **9 points**\n\n**How well do the overall `rna_FC` and `protein_FC` values correlate in this\nexperiment?**\n\nUsing the output from Question 2, do the following:  \n\n1. Create a scatter plot of `rna_FC` vs `protein_FC`. observe how the points scatter.\n\n2. Add a line to the plot that would indicate perfect 1:1 correlation.\n   Hint: use `geom_abline()` with its `slope` argument.\n   \n3. Add a linear model fit using `geom_smooth()` using its `method = 'lm'` argument.\n   Observe how the x=y line deviates from your geom_smooth line.\n\n4. Calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient. (Hint: This uses a base R math\n   function called `cor`. Use `?cor` or Google to learn more and how to specify\n   method as `spearman`.\n\n5. Using all of the information from above, comment on the correlation between\n   `rna_FC` and `protein_FC` below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Answer\n\n## Submit\n\nBe sure to click the \"Render\" button to render the HTML output.\n\nThen paste the URL of this Posit Cloud project into the problem set on Canvas.\n",
