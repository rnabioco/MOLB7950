You can start with a template. Each of these have a set of questions,\n       that you can build off of:\n      \n        - `dna-block/` explores an MNase-seq data set in\n        S. cerevisiae.  Sub-nucleosomal fragments provide a DNA-based signal to\n        understand chromatin transactions that lead to transcription.\n        \n        - `rna-block/published-data/` is the material Kent presented, examining the\n        role of A-to-I editing using RNA-seq.\n      \n        - `rna-block/rna-localization/`: is an exploration of neuronal RNA localization\n        by RNA-seq.\n\n    1. You could find a data set on [NCBI GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)\n       of interest (e.g., relevant to your thesis work), and work it up with\n       salmon, DEseq, and exploratory analysis.\n       \n    1. You can start with your own sequencing data (bulk/single-cell RNA seq,\n       DNA sequencing).\n\n## Deliverables     \n\n* An Rmarkdown document with code, plots, interpretations, and next steps.\n\n* If you work in a group, list the members of the group at the top of the document,\n  and make it clear which parts are your work by adding your initials to code chunks.\n\n* Short presentations (8-10 minutes) by the groups the week of Nov 28. Presentations\n  should include 1-2 slides of background, a hypothesis for the approach, code\n  output (table or graph) that addresses the hypothesis, and one or more tests\n  of the statistical significance of the observation.\n\n## Grading and rubric\n\nThe final project will be worth 20% of your grade and we will use the grading\nscheme outlined in the [grading rubric](syllabus.qmd#problem-set-rubric).\n\nEach individual in a group will be evaluated separately, so contributions must\nbe clearly marked in the document, using e.g. using chunk labels:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point()\n```\n:::",
