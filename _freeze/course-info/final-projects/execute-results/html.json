This can\n    refer to a publication and/or contain a link to public data\n    available at NCBI GEO.\n\n-   a hypothesis (tentative) you will be testing\n\n-   a few bullets on your planned analysis approach.\n\nPlease include this information in a quarto document in a new Posit\ncloud project.\n\n## Overview\n\n-   Final projects can involve groups of 1-3 people.\n\n-   Projects are choose your own adventure:\n\n    1.  The [resource documents](resources/block-dna-resources.qmd)\n        contain data sets in from human S. cerevisiae. For example,\n        sub-nucleosomal fragments provide a DNA-based signal to\n        understand chromatin transactions that lead to transcription.\n\n    2.  You could find a data set on [NCBI\n        GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) of interest (e.g.,\n        relevant to your thesis work), and work it up with salmon,\n        DEseq, and exploratory analysis. We are happy to help you work\n        through the pseudo-alignment steps.\n\n    3.  You can start with your own sequencing data (bulk/single-cell\n        RNA seq, DNA sequencing).\n\n## Deliverables\n\n-   A Quarto document with code, plots, interpretations, and next steps.\n\n-   If you work in a group, list the members of the group at the top of\n    the document, and make it clear which parts are your work by adding\n    your initials to code chunks.\n\n-   Short presentations (5-8 minutes) by the groups the week of Nov 1.\n    Presentations should include 1-2 slides of background, a hypothesis\n    for the approach, code output (table or graph) that addresses the\n    hypothesis, and one or more tests of the statistical significance of\n    the observation.\n\n## Grading and rubric\n\nThe final project will be worth 20% of your grade and we will use the\ngrading scheme outlined in the [grading\nrubric](syllabus.qmd#problem-set-rubric).\n\nEach individual in a group will be evaluated separately, so\ncontributions must be clearly marked in the document, using e.g. using\nchunk labels:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\n#| label: plotting-code-by-jay-h\n#| eval: false\nggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point()\n```\n````\n:::\n",
